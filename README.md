# -MakeoverMonday-Collaborative-Project
Collaborative Project with Robert Crocker and Mehsam Raza Hemani. The goal of our work is to create a working script to support Eva Murray and Andy Kriebel in gathering viz tweets. This data will then be visualized through Tableau and d3 to gain insights on the MakeoverMonday Project.
